# Overview

This is a weather forecast program. This program asks the user for a city, and shows the current weather and a forecast for the following 3 days. This can help users to check on the weather of cities they plan to visit, so they can plan accordingly or know how to prepare for the next days.

I did this to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used with webpages, and to show how already created APIs can help a lot in coding. I also used Visual Studio Code to demonstrate this can be done there.
